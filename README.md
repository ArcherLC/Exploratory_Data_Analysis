# Exploratory_Data_Analysis

In this repository you will find the scripts and plot png files for Coursera's Exploratory Data Analysis Project 1. This 
project consisted of the creation of four plots for analysis on household electric power consumption based on the 
UC Irvine Machine Learning Repository (link: http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/)

To get each plot, run the scripts titled plot1.R, plot2.R, plot3.R, and plot4R.
